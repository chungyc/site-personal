Yesterday, I saw a total solar eclipse with my own eyes for the first time in my life.
Arrangements for a trip to Lake Placid were made more than half a year ago,
and it was completely worth it.
I had seen a partial eclipse before, but a total eclipse was a completely different experience,
one that pictures do not do it justice.
