My family traveled to Los Angeles this winter break.

Los Angeles being a car-centric city, I rented a car,
and I decided it was time to finally try out an electric car,
something I had wanted to do for a long time.
It was a [Tesla Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/model3),
and notwithstanding my opinion of Tesla's CEO, I loved the car.
However, being the old fashioned sort, I did not trust its assistive driving features at all,
so even while I tried them out, I was laser-focused on taking over if needed,
which was a little tiring.  Fortunately, the car didn't do anything crazy.
However, it _was_ embarassing as I had trouble figuring out how to do things
that I was used to doing easily in other cars, such as the simple task of turning on the car,
although it was very simple once I got used to it.

Obviously because we were in the Los Angeles area,
we had to go to [Universal Studios](https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/)
and [Disneyland](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/destinations/disneyland/).
They were both a lot of fun.  In fact, they were a lot more fun than I was expecting.

We spent the extra money to upgrade our park passes to get onto shorter lines, which was not cheap.
However, it would have been a bigger waste to have flown all the way to Los Angeles
just to spend 90% of our time waiting in line, so it was worth it in our case.
A surprise was how good the food at Disneyland was.
I was expecting it to be the standard overpriced fare for an amusement,
but while still overpriced, it was far better than I expected it to be.

Being the Star Wars fan I am, I loved being at the
[Galaxy's Edge](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/destinations/disneyland/star-wars-galaxys-edge/) in Disneyland.
The lines for the [Rise of the Resistance](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disneyland/star-wars-rise-of-the-resistance/)
ride were extremely long, and I could see why after taking a ride on it.
If I were on my own, I would not have been able to resist all the Star Wars merchandise on sale
and would have returned home with a full set of Jedi attire, stormtrooper gear, and custom droids.
As it was, we did build our own
[custom lightsaber](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/shops/disneyland/savis-workshop-handbuilt-lightsabers/),
and I love it.
I also greatly enjoyed seeing all the best military fighters up close.

However, it _was_ odd seeing a [piece of junk](https://www.starwars.com/databank/millennium-falcon)
among all the great spacecraft.

Finally, I flew on the air flights to and from Los Angeles the best way there is to fly:
[watching](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/air-disasters)
and [reading](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/) about investigations of air crashes.
Learning about how airplanes crash and how their causes were found was a great way to spend the time while flying.
(I am not sure if I should be serious or ironic on this.)
