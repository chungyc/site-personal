Some time ago I dropped by a LEGO Store, which happened to have a Mirror of Erised.
It showed me as my true self, if I were to be a LEGO minifigure going to Hogwarts.
I am thinking about using this mirror image as one of my profile images.

They LEGO Store actually provided two versions of the image with different aspect ratios:

* [Small version](/images/lego/erised-figure-small.png)
