title: Using Diagrams

I plan on writing a few articles which would really be much better with images.
Unfortunately, I am bad at drawing, and I hate it, anyway.
I would much prefer declaring what an image should be,
and letting the computer handle the actual drawing.

[Diagrams] is a Haskell library and domain-specific language for
declaratively generating images, which would suit my purposes.
I have added support for adding images to my web site based on it,
and you can see me try it out on [one of the pages](/article/technical/website/diagrams/trying-out).

Some day I will write up what I did to make this work.
The code is available to inspect
on [GitHub](https://github.com/chungyc/site-personal/blob/main/src/Web/Site/Rules/Diagram.hs).
