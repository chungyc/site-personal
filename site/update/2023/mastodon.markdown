I have finally rejoined social media.
I have created an account on a [Mastodon] server with username [`@chungyc@mathstodon.xyz`].

The Mastodon server I joined is geared towards people who love math,
and it even supports rendering mathematics with [LaTeX].
I look forward to posting math tidbits I find interesting every so often,
although I don't know how often I'll be posting or what I'll be posting.
It could just be random math factoids, links to math blog posts I make,
or may even end up not focused on math.
