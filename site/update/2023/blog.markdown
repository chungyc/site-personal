title: Blog revamp

I have revamped my blog at [Stochastic Scribbles] again.
It had depended on a version of PHP that was getting too long in the tooth.
It also didn't help that if I wanted to do anything that needed special logic,
I would have to use PHP, and that is not going to happen.
For this reason, it was converted to use [Hakyll] as well.

The blog is going to be used for commentary or opinions on recent events,
or for random thoughts on random topics.  In contrast, this site will be
used for my own notes, updates about me, or for informational pages.
