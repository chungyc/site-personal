title: Drawing spacetime diagrams with Diagrams

I wanted to use spacetime diagrams to explain the twin paradox
from special relativity in a way different from most popular treatments.
To do that, I needed to be able to draw spacetime diagrams,
so obviously I added support to my site for doing [Lorentz transformations]
with [Diagrams].

I wanted to test that it works, and what better way to test it than
with an article explaining [spacetime diagrams]?  And that is exactly what I did.
