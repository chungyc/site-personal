Special relativity [@carroll2022; @susskind2017]

## World lines

![A wandering world line](/diagrams/article/relativity/proper-time/random-line.svg)

## Spacetime intervals

![Measuring time for a moving object](/diagrams/article/relativity/proper-time/measuring-time.svg)

\[ ds^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^z \]

\[ dx = dy = dz = 0 \]

\[ ds^2 = dt^2 \]

## Proper time

\[ d\tau = ds \]

![Switching between inertial frames](/diagrams/article/relativity/proper-time/discrete-lines.svg)

\[ \tau = \sum \Delta\tau = \sum \Delta s \]

![Smoothly transitioning between inertial frames](/diagrams/article/relativity/proper-time/continuous-line.svg)

\[ \tau = \int d\tau = \int ds \]

\[ ds = \sqrt{dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2} \]
