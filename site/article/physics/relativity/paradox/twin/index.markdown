Discusses the twin paradox in special relativity [@carroll2022; @susskind2017].
In particular, discusses what happens in the reference frames of the traveling twin,
which is often glossed over in many popular treatments of the topic.

## The "paradox" {#intro}

Let's say there are twins.  One of them stays on Earth.
The other twin travels to a star near the speed of light and comes back.
Due to [time dilation], time for the twin traveling to the star
passes more slowly from the inertial frame of the twin staying on Earth.
But for the traveling twin, it is the twin staying on Earth which is moving
and whose time is passing more slowly.

Both twins supposedly observe time flowing more slowly for the other twin.
But when they meet up back on Earth and compare their clocks,
they can't both be right, can they?
