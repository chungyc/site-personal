Discusses the twin paradox in special relativity [@carroll2022; @susskind2017].
In particular, discusses what happens in the reference frames of the traveling twin,
which is often glossed over in many popular treatments of the topic.

## The "paradox" {#intro}

Let's say there are twins.  One of them stays on Earth.
The other twin travels to a star near the speed of light and comes back.
Due to [time dilation], time for the twin traveling to the star
passes more slowly from the inertial frame of the twin staying on Earth.
But for the traveling twin, it is the twin staying on Earth which is moving
and whose time is passing more slowly.

Both twins supposedly observe time flowing more slowly for the other twin.
But when they meet up back on Earth and compare their clocks,
they can't both be right, can they?

## Standard popular treatment {#popular-treatment}

Indeed, when the twins meet up back on Earth and compare their clocks,
they would see that time had passed more slowly for the twin who traveled to the star.
So the twin paradox is not truly a paradox.

Most popular treatments of the twin paradox point out that the traveling twin
must accelerate and does not stay in a single inertial frame.
It would be incorrect to conclude that time for the twin on Earth
consistently passes slowly from the perspective of the traveling twin.
Some may even point out that for any world line which starts and ends
at the same two events, the straight one will [experience the most time],
which in this case would be the world line for the twin who stays on Earth.
Below is a [spacetime diagram] for these world lines from
the inertial frame of Earth.

[experience the most time]: ../../proper-time/#longest

[spacetime diagram]: ../../spacetime-diagrams

These explanations are absolutely correct.
However, I have always found them highly unsatisfactory.
It's not as if the traveling twin cannot observe anything,
but popular treatments of the twin paradox
almost never discuss anything about what they see.

In addition, let's say the traveling twin only accelerates when they depart from Earth,
when they turn around at the star, and when they stop at Earth.
For most of the trip to the star, they would be in a single inertial frame,
and from this inertial frame, time for the twin on Earth will indeed pass more slowly.
Likewise for the trip back from the star to Earth.
And yet at the end it is the time for the traveling twin which had passed more slowly.
What happened during the acceleration to end up in this state?

Even worse, let's say there are two twins who travel to and back from two different stars
that are at the same distance but in opposite directions.
For both twins, time for the other twin should be passing more slowly
during the outbound trip and the inbound trip,
and yet when they meet up back at Earth,
it will turn out that the same amount of time had passed for both of them.
How could this be?

Is it the case that special relativity is unable to infer anything about
what an observer sees if they do not permanently stay in a single inertial frame?
Do we need to reach for general relativity to figure any of this out?
