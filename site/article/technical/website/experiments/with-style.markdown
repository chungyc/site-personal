I would like to start on this page.

This is me saying something.

## Level two heading

And another thing.

### Level three heading

And yet another thing.

#### Level four heading

So many things to talk about.

##### Level five heading

But everything that has been talked about is rather trivial.

###### Level six heading

We really need to talk about something more interesting.

## Lists

This is a plain list.

*   First item.
*   Second item.
*   Third item.
*   Fourth item.
    *   First nested item.
    *   Second nested item.
        *   First nested nested item.
        *   Second nested nested item.
        *   Third nested nested item.
    *   Third nested item.
*   Fifth item.
*   This list item has more than one paragraph.

    See?  I am another paragraph!
*   Seventh item.
*   Another item with more than one paragraph!

    It's true.
    *   It also has a nested list item.

        This also happens to have more than one paragraph.
*   Ninth item.

That was a long list.

## Definition lists

This is a definition list.

something
:   Something to define.

another thing
:   Yet another thing to define.

yet another thing
:   See a pattern here?

    It could be a mirage.

This paragraph is not a definition list.

## Images

This is an SVG image.

![SVG image](/diagrams/article/diagrams/first.svg)

This is the same image, but keeps the same colors
regardless of whether the device is in light or dark mode.

![SVG image which keeps colors](/diagrams/article/diagrams/first.svg){.keep-colors}

This is an image in PNG format.
It should also maintain the same colors despite the preferred color scheme.

## Bibliography

Let's see if we can do bibliographic references.
I like the RISC-V instruction set manual [@riscv:user-level].
