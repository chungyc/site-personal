\subsection{Quote of a random day}

Someone may or may not have said this on some random day:

\begin{quote}
  To be or not to be \ldots

  Is this \emph{seriously} a question?
\end{quote}

It does not really mean anything.

\subsection{Source}

Yes, there is a \href{https://github.com/chungyc/site-personal/tree/main/site/article/technical/website/experiments/latex.tex}{source file}
for this page.
