I'm trying out using [Diagrams] for including images in the web site.
Let's see if this works.

## First diagram

The following is the first diagram I tried:

```haskell
myCircle :: Diagram B
myCircle = circle 1 # fc red

main = putDiagram defaultOptions myCircle
```

It is a circle filled with the color red.

![First diagram](/diagrams/article/diagrams/first.svg)

In subsequent code snippets, I will omit the definition of the `main` function.
It will almost always be the same, but it is not part of the implicitly
included boilerplate that this site uses for the code.
This is to allow customizations of the `main` function,
in particular the options, in the rare cases where it might be needed.

## Combining diagrams

A circle atop another:

```haskell
example :: Diagram B
example = circle 2 # lc purple `atop` circle 1 # lc green
```

![Circle atop another](/diagrams/article/diagrams/combine1.svg)

A circle and a square side by side:

```haskell
example :: Diagram B
example = circle 1 ||| square 2
```

![Circle and square side by side](/diagrams/article/diagrams/combine2.svg)

A circle stacked on above a square:

```haskell
example :: Diagram B
example = circle 1 === square 2
```

![Circle above square](/diagrams/article/diagrams/combine3.svg)

Three rows of growing circles:

```haskell
circles :: Diagram B
circles = hcat $ map circle [1..6]

example :: Diagram B
example = vcat $ replicate 3 circles
```

## Aligning shapes

Circles of different sizes aligned on the top:

```haskell
example :: Diagram B
example = hrule (2 * sum sizes) === circles # centerX
  where
    circles = hcat $ map (alignT . (`scale` circle 1)) sizes
    sizes = [2, 5, 4, 7, 1, 3]
```

## Fractals

These diagrams are from the [diagrams-contrib] package.

A Koch snowflake:

```haskell
import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.IteratedSubset

example :: Diagram B
example = strokeTrail $ snowflake 5
```

![Koch snowflake](/diagrams/article/diagrams/snowflake.svg)

A Sierpinski triangle:

```haskell
import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.LSystem

example :: Diagram B
example = getTurtleDiagram $ sierpinski 8
```

![Sierpinski triangle](/diagrams/article/diagrams/sierpinski.svg)

Tree figure generated with an L-system:

```haskell
import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.LSystem

example :: Diagram B
example = rotateBy 0.25 $ getTurtleDiagram $ tree4 7
```

![A tree](/diagrams/article/diagrams/tree4.svg)

## Conclusion

Yes, it works.

I am terrible at drawing images by hand.
I don't even want to draw anything by hand.
So getting images declaratively generated by [Diagrams]
whenever I need one is going to be a great help.
