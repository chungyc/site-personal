Personal notes on hypothesis testing in statistics.

Based on notes taken during a course [@coursera:statistical-inference-hypothesis-testing].

## Hypotheses {#hypotheses}

null hypothesis
:   Hypothesis assumed to be true.  Often denoted by $H_0$.

alternative hypothesis
:   Hypothesis for which we are looking for evidence.  Often denoted by $H_1$ or $H_a$.

simple hypothesis
:   Hypothesis which completely specifies the distribution.

composite hypothesis
:   Hypothesis which is not simple.  I.e., aspects of the distribution are left unspecified.

Hypothesis testing either rejects or fails to reject the null hypothesis.

## Types of error {#error-types}

Type I error
:   Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

Type II error
:   Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
